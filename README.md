# SCT_ML_02
Student Marks Clustering using K-Means
This project applies K-Means clustering to group students based on their performance in two subjects. It uses data preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and evaluation metrics to identify High Performers and Low Performers.
 
 

 ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… K-Means clustering to group students into performance clusters

âœ… Performance evaluation using:

Inertia (SSE)

Silhouette Score

Davies-Bouldin Index

âœ… Cluster visualization with Matplotlib

âœ… Exporting clustered data to CSV

âœ… Custom marker, color, and edge settings for better visuals
